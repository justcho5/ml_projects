```
project2/                              # Contains all project files
├── data/                              # should contains the trainig and test file ( eg. test.csv and train.csv )
└── plots/                             # Plot output
└── script/
    ├── implementation.py
    ├── helpers.py
    └── run.py
    └── Plot.ipynb
```


**run.py**

Main file which contains the code for training and prediction.

**Plot.ipynb**

Jupyter file, used to generate the plots for the report.

**helpers.py**

Provided helper file.


### Requirements

The python code has been tested with the following versions:

```
Python: 3.6.2
Numpy: 1.13.1
Pandas: xx
Surprise: xx
```

In order to generate the prediction file simply run the run.py script:

The test.csv and train.csv must be provided in project1/data/

    python run.py

This will create the output file in *project1/data/output.csv*
